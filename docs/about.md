I am a security analyst that has spent the last 20-ish years working in federal government spaces performing a rather wide range of jobs including threat hunting, detection engineering, malware analysis and incident response. Currently, I perform threat intelligence analysis, hunt for threats on ICS/SCADA/OT/IT networks, and create Splunk-based detections. In my free time I'm thinking up new ways for malicious actors to make life tough for the blue team and how to detect them, coming up with ideas on how to make the blue/purple process better using machine learning and the latest "artificial intelligence" tooling, or even maybe playing some video games. Assuming that family stuff isn't taking priority at the moment.
