  This is one of my earliest blog entries during the time I was still completing my degree. It was one of my first attempts at analyzing the situation I found myself in.

I got to thinking yesterday after taking the test for Security+ certification, of what use are IT certifications to the average person hoping to land a job in the IT world?  For those of us looking for a new job position, it’s an almost universal requirement to have some sort of IT certification no matter where you apply for a job at.  Now, if you are an entry level person like me, then they may be a way to prove you know some basics about a subject and are worth hiring.  However, what about those individuals who have the multiple years of experience in a specialized sector of Information Technology, do these individuals really need that certification or should their level of experience speak for itself?

Let’s start by looking at some of the “entry-level” certifications like those from CompTIA.  Most people would agree that A+ and Network+ are your rock bottom entry level certifications.  What does it take to become A+ or Network + certified?

If you are looking to acquire your A+ certification, it is generally recommended that you have roughly 500 hours of hands on experience with basic computer repair, networking, and troubleshooting.  Before taking the Network+, CompTIA recommends achieving A+ certification and having a minimum of 9 months networking experience, but these are not required.  So, assuming you have all this experience, is it really worth your time to get certified?

According to the [Foote Research Group](https://web.archive.org/web/20090520164226/http://www.footepartners.com/FooteNewsrelease_2009skillstrends_041609V1.pdf) as of the first quarter of 2009, certifications are becoming increasingly valuable in providing a little more job security in the IT field.  Of specific interest were the security related certifications.  The highest paying certifications tended to be the higher level ones like Microsoft Certified Solution Developer (MCSD) and the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM). There are some skills and certifications of course that have decreased in value, among them are skills in C++ and Network+ certification.

It appears that the question of whether or not you really need to be certified can only be answered in the context of what you hope to be doing in your IT career.  Some workplaces may require you to have certain certifications while others really don’t seem to care a whole lot.  If we were going off of the information presented here, I would say that it would be in everyone’s best interest to acquire at least a couple certifications if you hope to go anywhere in the IT field.  The trick is guessing which ones are going to pay off the most in the long run.

For those people with years of experience it looks like companies still want the appropriate level of certifications from you.  Being certified appears to bring a much higher confidence value in regards to your skills as they apply to your specialization within Information Technology.  This isn’t to say that those people without the certification couldn’t do the job, it just appears that those who are certified have a better chance of keeping their job in the current economy.

Sound off!  Tell me what you think about certifications.
